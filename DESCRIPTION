Description: 
    EasyPubROC is an R package designed to simplify the process of performing Receiver 
    Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and generating publication-quality ROC curves. 
    It provides a user-friendly interface for calculating AUC (Area Under the Curve), 
    sensitivity, specificity, and other ROC-related metrics. The package is particularly 
    tailored for researchers and data scientists who need to perform ROC analysis for 
    scientific publications, clinical studies, or machine learning model evaluation. 
    EasyROC integrates seamlessly with popular R packages like `pROC` and `ggplot2` to 
    ensure flexibility and high-quality visual outputs.
